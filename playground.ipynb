      "- Closed captions not only make your content more accessible, they can also help you improve your video rankings and traffic. So in this video, we're gonna look at why captions matter and I'm gonna show you how to add subtitles on your YouTube videos, including the best way that we found to get accurate closed captions on your content automatically. Super fast without any manual transcription. Hey, it's Justin Brown here from Primal Video where we help you amplify your business and brand with video. If you're new here, make sure you click that subscribe button and all the links to everything we mention in this video, you can find linked in the description box below, so let's jump into it. Closed captions are a great way to improve the ranking potential of your videos and also make them accessible for a broader audience. Not only do they make your content easier to understand for those who might be hard of hearing, or for those who aren't native speakers of your language. They also send some positive ranking indicators through to YouTube, as to the actual content inside of your videos, helping YouTube get your videos in front of the right people at the right time. By knowing exactly what's covered your video, YouTube will accurately match it with the search terms that your ideal viewers are using and even start ranking specific clips from within your videos in Google search results as well. Check out this example of one of our YouTube videos and how it shows up in Google search. It's actually highlighted and it's suggesting a certain section of our video where we cover that specific piece that the user has searched for. And this is based only on the transcript of what I've said inside the video. And another way that Google is starting to use this as well is it is listing out specific content areas inside of your videos, so all of these timestamps, all of these time codes were generated from Google and YouTube just by looking at the transcript of what we've said inside of our videos. So that's why they matter, but how do you actually do it? Well, there's a few different ways that you can do this. So, I'm gonna share with you exactly how we do it here at Primal Video, but first up, the default for a lot of people is actually just to rely on the automatically generated transcriptions that YouTube itself creates. The advantage of that is that it's completely free and it also happens automatically, but they're really not very accurate. In fact, some of the results are pretty hilarious. And that's why there is a whole series dedicated to caption fail videos on YouTube, but from there, you can actually manually edit your captions to fix any of those issues. This is incredibly time consuming, but it does mean that you get full control, so that you can make sure manually that it is 100% correct, but there's also another option and that's what we use at Primal Video. That is a service called Rev. It is an amazing service allowing you to create captions and subtitles for your videos really, really easy with a 99% level of accuracy because it's done by humans. And it also integrates and links with your YouTube channel, making this whole process really, really easy. So I'm gonna take you through the process now of getting this set up to get these accurate captions directly onto your YouTube videos. This is Rev.com and you can see straight away they offer transcription, captions and even foreign subtitles as well. So, you wanna go ahead and create an account or login. This is the dashboard area and this is where you can access all of your previously captioned or transcribed videos. We're gonna go to the top here to place a new order. We're gonna go down to captions. Now you got the option here to link to a public video, to upload a video and audio file directly from your computer or you can even pull your videos in directly from your YouTube or Vimeo account and this is where it gets really cool. We're gonna select YouTube and the first time you do this, you will need to link your YouTube account, so you can come up here to add your YouTube account. Select your YouTube account and you will need to allow access so that Rev can access your videos and then you're able to see all the latest videos on your channel. And you can check the box here if you only wanna show the videos that don't already have a caption file associated with it and you also need to be aware that private videos can't be selected here, so this is only gonna work for public videos or unlisted videos that are on your channel. So, we'll go ahead now and we'll select a video. Now, you can select multiple videos in here as well if you wanted to get more than one captioned at a time. Normally for us, we will do this in bulk, but for now, I'll just select this one and we'll go add selected to cart. So you can see we've got our Instagram video editing apps video there. It is a 14 minute video, which is code support that information through from YouTube and the way that Rev charges to create this captions for us, and remember they're done by humans with a 99% accuracy, is only $1.25 per minute. So it looks at the video itself and says it's 14 minutes, which calculates it out as $17.50, which is ridiculously cheap considering that a human is going to be typing this out. It's also giving us an estimated delivery time of around nine hours and in all my experiences it actually comes back earlier than whatever that estimated delivery time is, but they do say they aim to get you captions done in under 24 hours. Now, you've got some other options down at the bottom here as well, if you do wanna rush your order through. You can add an extra dollar per minute and that will expedite this project for you and it says it will delivered up to five times faster. And also, if you wanna add in any foreign language subtitles, you can do that in here as well, adding in an additional $3 per minute per language. This is something that we haven't bothered adding to our videos yet, but it could be something that we look at in the future. But the other thing that I really love about this is this little checkbox down the bottom here. Automatically deliver files back to YouTube, so what this says is when the caption files are complete, you'll receive an email confirmation and then Rev will attempt to upload that captions file directly to the appropriate video and it says to allow one to two hours for that to happen. So this mean that beyond this page, once you have paid the $17.50, that transcription, that caption will be automatically uploaded to your video with no additional work from you. Imagine if you're doing this in bulk and you're doing three or four videos at a time, it's just one simple process, click a couple of buttons and those captions are going to automatically show up on your videos. So from here, all you need to do is hit the checkout button, select your payment method, come down and hit place order and you are done. So once that captioning is done, you'll be sent an email saying that it's complete and it's also live on your YouTube channel. If you wanna download a copy of that SRT file, you can just click on the link here you'll be taken direct to a download page for that. In case you wanna use that on another platform like Facebook, maybe, or if you just wanna read through the transcription or make any manual edits to it yourself, you can hit the little edit button here or log back into Rev and you can see straight away it's boarding your YouTube video with all of the captions and everything added. And if we head over to that video on our YouTube channel, go down to edit video, go over to subtitles. We can see that we've got our new transcription in here. If we go back and play that video, come down the bottom here to close captions you can see that our accurate text is on here, not the YouTube auto generated one. This is the accurate one from Rev. So that's how easy it is to add captions and subtitles to your YouTube videos automatically with amazing level of accuracy to help your videos show up on the platform to help with your YouTube ranking, but also to help people consume your content as well. If you are looking at how you can improve your video ranking on YouTube, then check out the video linked on screen where we take you through the top three tools to help you get your videos showing up on the platform. And I'll see you in the next one.\n"

       "[\"Closed captions are a great way to improve the ranking potential of your videos and also make them accessible for a broader audience. They send positive ranking indicators through to YouTube, as to the actual content. By knowing exactly what's covered your video, YouTube will accurately match it with the search terms that your ideal viewers are using and even start ranking specific clips from within the videos in Google search results as well.
